# Final project proposal

## Hardware/software proposal 1
Component one will slowly shift the color of the RGB LED when push button 0 is pressed. It will 
involve using the debouncer hardware from earlier labs for debouncing, as well as establishing a 
register to store the push button input. From this point, the red, green, and blue registers can
be used to shift the color
## Hardware/software proposal 2
Component two will control the speed of a servo motor using the de10-nano's switches. Hardware will
be established to store the switch inputs, which will be sent to a software register. From thish point,
a PWM signal will be generated with a duty cycle according to the value of the switch inputs.

## Division of labor
Briefly describe who will be working on what. For extra credit tasks and any software above the driver level, it is okay for both group members to work on a single piece, so long as the division of labor and responsibilities are clear.
